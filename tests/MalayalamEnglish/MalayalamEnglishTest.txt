Florence passed a sleepless night. It had come upon her so suddenly, this expulsion from the home of her childhood, that she could not fully realize it. She could not feel that she was taking her last look at the familiar room, and well-remembered dining-room, where she had sat down for the last time for breakfast. She was alone at the breakfast table, for the usual hour was half-past eight, and she had appointed Dodger to call for her at eight.

"Good-morning, Master Grant," he said, pleasantly. "Are you getting your sea legs on?" The name was unfamiliar to Dodger, but he could see that the remark was addressed to him.

Curtis quietly ignored the allusion to Tim, for it did not suit his purpose to get Tim into trouble. His unscrupulous agent knew too much that would compromise his principal.

Florence was somewhat cheered by Mrs. O'Keefe's refusal to believe that Dodger was in any serious trouble, but she could not wholly free herself from uneasiness. When eleven o'clock came she went to bed very unwillingly, and got very little rest during the night. Morning came, and still Dodger did not show up. As we know, he was fairly started on his long voyage, though he had not yet recovered consciousness.

Miss Emily Carter had for a considerable time tried to fascinate Mr. de Brabazon, whose wealth made him a very desirable match, and she viewed his decided penchant for Florence with alarm and indignation.

When Florence left the employ of Mrs. Leighton she had a few dollars as a reserve fund. As this would not last long, she at once made an effort to obtain employment.
"Suppose time passes, and she doesn't? Won't he try to find her? As she is in the city, that won't be hard."
He was rather surprised that the old gentleman, who, according to his own representation, was riding upon the elevated road for the first time, seemed to feel no curiosity on the subject, but conducted himself in all respects like an experienced traveler.

Florence left the house indignant and mortified. It was something new to her to be regarded as a social inferior, and she felt sure that there were many in Mrs. Leighton's position who would have seen no harm in her behavior on the previous evening.

The tears fell upon the paper as she was writing, but she heeded them not. It was the saddest hour of her life. Hitherto she had been shielded from all sorrow, and secure in the affection of her uncle, had never dreamed that there would come a time when she would feel obliged to leave all behind her, and go out into the world, friendless and penniless, but poorest of all in the loss of that love which she had hitherto enjoyed.
"So did I," said the woman, with a sigh. "I wish I were back there again."

"You are, at any rate. What does the woman want, I'd like to know?" "She doesn't want me. It seems Mrs. Leighton did not speak very highly of me."
"If I might be so bold, what kind of work are you going to do?" "I hardly know. It has come upon me so suddenly. I shall have to do something, for I haven't got much money. What I should like best would be to write----" "Is it for the papers you mean?" "Oh, no; I mean for some author or lawyer." "I don't know much about that," said Mrs. O'Keefe. "In fact, I don't mind tellin' you, my dear, that I can't write myself, but I earn a good livin' all the same by my apple-stand. I tell you, my dear," she continued in a confidential tone, "there is a good dale of profit in sellin' apples. It's better than sewin' or writin'. Of course, a young leddy like you wouldn't like to go into the business."

"I shan't forget that," said Florence, amused. "I will buy a ruler of good hard wood, and then you must look out. But, tell me, where have you lived hitherto?"

I've got a bed in one corner--it's tucked away in a closet in the day."

I admit, Miss Linden, that you are very ladylike in appearance, but, I can hardly be expected to admit into my house, in the important position of governess to my child, the daughter or niece of an apple-woman."
Mrs. Leighton listened with surprised approval.
As she entered the handsomely decorated rooms on the night of the party, she looked around her nervously, fearing to see some one whom she had known in earlier days. She noticed one only--Percy de Brabazon, whose face lighted up when he saw her, for he had been expecting to see her.
"There's them that stands higher that isn't half so good," retorted Jane, with more zeal than good grammar.

Mrs. Leighton's tone was cold and unfriendly, and Florence felt that something unpleasant was coming.

There was something in the child's face that looked familiar to Dodger. It was a resemblance to some one that he had seen, but he could not for the life of him decide who it was.
"That's what I told her, Tim," said Mrs. O'Keefe. "I told Florence there was worse men than you."
"And you, I suppose, are the gentleman?" said Curtis, in a sneering tone.

"May I--aw--have the pleasure of calling upon you to-morrow evening, Miss Linden?" "It is evident that you have not heard that I am no longer residing with my uncle."

Florence took a very light breakfast, and at the usual time went to Mrs. Leighton's to meet her pupil. When the study hour was over, she did not remain to lunch, but hurried back, stopping at Mrs. O'Keefe's apple-stand just as that lady was preparing to go home to prepare dinner.

"I don't allow no one to call me a liar. Just take that back, old man, or I----" "Indeed, uncle, he took nothing, for he had only just opened the secretary when I woke up and spoke to him."

"How have you done it?" "By taking in sewing. But that is a hard way of earning money. There are too many poor women who are ready to work for starvation wages, and so we all suffer." "I know that," answered Dodger. "Do you live near here?" The woman mentioned a street near by.

"I sincerely wish the boy might be restored to you," said Curtis; but his tone belied his words. "Believe me, the loss of the property would affect me little, if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest desire; but, uncle, I think it only the part of a friend to point out to you, as I have already done, the baselessness of any such expectation."

That was not all. At the bottom of the valise was an envelope, sealed, on which was inscribed the name: "Dodger." "That is for me, at any rate," thought our hero. "I suppose it is from Curtis Waring."
"I know nothing of it," said Florence, coldly, rising from her recumbent position, and drawing aloof from Curtis.
"And why not? I'm well and strong, and I'm makin' more money than I nade."
Dodger was a little disappointed. Still, he could not help admitting that it would be better for Florence to teach three hours, than to work ten or twelve. As to her having any objection to appearing at a dime museum, that never occurred to him.

"That's better than sellin' papers alone," thought he. "Besides, Tim isn't likely to come across me here. I wonder I didn't think of settin' up for myself before!" In the evening he spent an hour, and sometimes more, pursuing his studies, under the direction of Florence. At first his attention was given chiefly to improving his reading and spelling, for Dodger was far from fluent in the first, while his style of spelling many words was strikingly original.

By way of reply, the rough visitor coolly seated himself in a luxurious easy-chair, and, looking up into the angry face of Waring, said: "Oh, no, you won't."

Florence took the note, and, opening it, read these lines:     "Florence: Now that you have had time to think over your plan     of leaving your old home, I hope you have come to see how     foolish it is. Reflect that, if carried out, a life of     poverty and squalid wretchedness amid homely and uncongenial     surroundings awaits you; while, as my wife, you will live a     life of luxury and high social position. There are many young     ladies who would be glad to accept the chance which you so     recklessly reject. By accepting my hand you will gratify our     excellent uncle, and make me the happiest of mortals. You     will acquit me of mercenary motives, since you are now     penniless, and your disobedience leaves me sole heir to Uncle     John. I love you, and it will be my chief object, if you will     permit it, to make you happy.

Then, fixing her eyes upon him keenly: "Why should uncle insist upon this marriage? Is it not because you have influenced him in the matter?" "No," answered Curtis, falsely. "He has some secret reason, which he will not disclose to me, for desiring it."
The little girl eyed her with approval. This beautiful young lady was a pleasant surprise to her, for, never having had a governess, she expected to meet a stiff, elderly lady, of stern aspect. She readily gave her hand to Florence, and looked relieved.

Dodger now comprehended his present situation fully. He was a passenger on the ship _Columbia_, and there was no chance of leaving it. He had ascertainel on inquiry that the vessel would not put in anywhere, but would make the long voyage direct. It would be over four months, at any rate, before he could communicate with Florence, and in the meantime, she and Mrs. O'Keefe, whom he recognized as a good friend, would conclude that he was dead.
