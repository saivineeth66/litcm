"Of course I am devoted to your interests, but is it quite fair to make me wait till you come into your fortune before allowing me anything?" "I think so."
Mr. Tucker was reluctant to part with Dodger.

"I can make that man useful!" he reflected. "There is an element of danger in the boy's presence in New York; but it will go hard if I can't get rid of him! Tim Bolton is unexpectedly squeamish, but there are others to whom I can apply. With gold everything is possible. It's time matters came to a finish. My uncle's health is rapidly failing-- the doctor hints that he has heart disease--and the fortune for which I have been waiting so long will soon be mine, if I work my cards right. I can't afford to make any mistakes now."

"True; and the boy is asleep, as you will see. He is going to make the voyage for his health, and, as he has been suffering some pain, I thought I would not wake him up. Who will direct me to his stateroom?" The mate summoned the steward, and Dodger, still unconscious, was brought on board and quietly transferred to the bunk that had been prepared for him.

"Thrue for you, my dear. We might go round to the police headquarters and inquire if the boy's been run in."
"Not a drop. She was a good, sober lady, if she did work in a dime museum. She only left here two weeks ago. It isn't every one I'd be willin' to take in her place, but I see you're a real leddy, let alone that Dodger recommends you. I hope you'll like the room, and I'll do all I can to make things pleasant. You can go into my room any hour, my dear, and do your little cookin' on my stove. I s'pose you'll do your own cookin'?" "Well, not just at present," faltered Florence. "I am afraid I don't know much about cooking."
Dodger did not understand the nature of women or the mysteries of the female heart, and he evidently thought this poor woman very foolish to cling with such pertinacity to a man like Curtis Waring.

"I shall see Curtis again," she said. "How can I ever thank you?" But Dodger, though unwilling to disturb her dreams of happiness, thought it exceedingly doubtful if her husband would be equally glad to see her.
The old gentleman drew a paper from his pocket, and began to read, while Dodger, left to his own devices, sat quiet and looked about him.

"Ah, there, Dodger!" Dodger, who had been busily and successfully selling evening papers in front of the Astor House, turned quickly as he heard his name called.
"What is your usual time between New York and San Francisco?" asked Curtis, addressing the mate.
Curtis was about to throw the card into the grate, but on second thought dropped it into his pocket.

"I have no doubt you would," answered Dodger; "but I don't think you will. Were you going to rob this man?" "None of your business!" "I shall make it my business. You'd better go, or you may be locked up."
When I asked her whether she will give life for me , she quickly opened her mobile phone and sent me a Candy Crush life . Appo Adhane ? 
"You work too hard, Florence, wid your teacher. That is what gives you the headache."
   "P. S.--Don't let on to Curtis that you have heard from me,     or he might try to play me some trick in San Francisco."

"What is the boy's name?" asked the mate.
"I often go to the opewa. It's so--so fashionable, don't you know?" "Then you don't go to hear the music?" "Oh, of course, but one can't always be listening to the music, don't you know. I had a fwiend with me last evening--an Englishman--a charming fellow, I assure you. He's the second cousin of a lord, and yet--you'll hardly credit it--we're weally vewy intimate. He tells me, Miss Florence, that I'm the perfect image of his cousin, Lord Fitz Noodle."
In this emergency the pawnbroker occurred to her.

"One more flight of stairs, my dear," said Mrs. O'Keefe, encouragingly. "I've got four rooms upstairs; one of them is for you, and one for Dodger." Florence did not reply. She began to understand at what cost she had secured her freedom from a distasteful marriage.
